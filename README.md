# About Our Software

Our project is a competitive and fun game between 4 players where they must try and win each round, all centering around one weird word. We play around with the definitions, example sentences and even the spelling of the word. And inbetween some of the rounds, there will be minigames and power-ups to keep the players on their toes. 
## Platforms Tested on
